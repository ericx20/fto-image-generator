# FTO Image Generator (CIF)

This tool generates useful images for the Face-Turning Octahedron puzzle.
It's only made for the CIF (corner-in-front) notation, so the puzzle is held with one of the corners facing you.

Created by err0rcuber with input from [Michael James Straughan](https://github.com/mjstraughan/).
Powered by cubing.js and inspired by [Ra√∫l Low's FTO Edge-in-front image generator](https://fto-image-generator.vercel.app/).

Work in progress, need to add more stickerings. I'm considering expanding the tool to more puzzles.
